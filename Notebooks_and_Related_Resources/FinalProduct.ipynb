    "This infographic compares the success of simple songs and complex songs to determine whether the presence of change within songs influenced their Billboard ranking. The Billboard Melodic Music Dataset, used to explore this question, includes the top 5 songs from each year between 1950 and 2022 along with their BPM (beats per minute), mode, tonic, and number of parts. If there was more than one tempo or a key change listed for a song, this was also included in the dataset. The 75th percentile of songs have 4 or less parts, meaning that having more than 4 parts causes a particular song to undergo more changes than others. A song was categorized as \"complex\" if it exhibited change in BPM, tonic, mode, or had more than 4 parts.  Across the 72 years that this data was collected, 321 of the top five songs were simple and only 52 were complex.  This explains why more simple songs occupied the number one position over songs that included changes. Calculating a Rank 1 Success Rate was necessary to compare the success of each structure group fairly. This rate, employed in the rightmost bar graph, is the percentage of each structure group's total Top 5 songs that reached the #1 position, removing the bias of the overall prevalence of simple songs.  Despite the greater number of simple songs charting in the top 5, there is a higher percentage of top-five complex songs that reach #1 than that of simple songs.  Therefore, if a more complex song ranked the top five, it historically had a greater probability of occupying the highest ranking slot. "
